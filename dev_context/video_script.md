**SCENE 1: INTRO & PROBLEM**

**(MUSIC: Upbeat, slightly techy, intro music - fades after ~5 seconds)**

**NARRATOR (Friendly, Enthusiastic):**
Hi everyone! Ever feel like you're drowning in security alerts for your projects? You want to keep your code safe, but sometimes it‚Äôs just... too much. Today, we're going to explore this common challenge and a potential solution.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 1: Title Slide - "The Alert Overload")**

    *   Title: "The Security Alert Overload: A Developer's Dilemma"
    *   Subtitle: "Keeping projects secure without drowning in notifications."
    *   Background: A dynamic, abstract background suggesting code or data streams. Maybe a subtle animation of many small notification icons appearing and fading.
*   **Screenshot (Optional):** A small, stylized screenshot of a crowded email inbox with many "Dependabot Alert" subjects, or a section of a GitHub security tab with numerous alerts.

**SCENE 2: MEET ERWAN - THE PAIN POINT**

**NARRATOR:**
Let's meet Erwan. Erwan, could you tell us a bit about your development life?

**ERWAN (Slightly tired but passionate developer voice):**
"Hey! Yeah, so I'm Erwan. I love coding, always got a few personal projects on the go ‚Äì you know, trying out new ideas, building things for fun or to learn. I use tools like GitHub's Dependabot to keep an eye on security vulnerabilities in my dependencies. It's supposed to help, right?"

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 2: Erwan's Profile & Initial Alerts)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Meet Erwan: The Passionate Developer"
    *   A simple, friendly avatar/icon representing Erwan.
    *   Text snippet (from Erwan's voiceover): "Always tinkering... building cool new things."
*   **Screenshot:** A clean screenshot of a GitHub Dependabot email notification. Maybe another one pops up next to it as Erwan speaks.

**ERWAN:**
"But honestly? My inbox is a warzone. It's just *flooded* with these alerts: 'High severity in package X,' 'Critical update for Y.' It's constant! And I start thinking, 'Okay, but is this *actually* a problem for *my* little blog? Am I even *using* that specific part of the library they're talking about?'"

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 3: The Flood of Alerts & Erwan's Dilemma)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "The Daily Deluge: Too Many Alerts!"
    *   Text snippet: "Are all of these *really* a problem for *my* specific project?"
    *   A visual representation of many alerts (e.g., a collage of notification icons or a stylized overflowing inbox).
*   **Screenshot:** A zoomed-in screenshot of a typical Dependabot alert email, highlighting the CVE and package name. Maybe add a large question mark overlaying part of it.

**ERWAN:**
"After a while, with so many alerts and most of them feeling like they don't directly apply or I don't have time to dig into every single one... I'll admit, I started tuning them out. It's bad, I know! But it's just too much noise, and I worry I'm missing the *really* important stuff because of it."

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 4: Alert Fatigue & Its Consequences)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Alert Fatigue Sets In"
    *   Text: "Ignoring alerts = Potential risks slip through."
    *   Icon: A "snooze" icon or an "X" over a pile of alerts. Erwan's avatar looking dismissive.
*   **Screenshot (Optional):** A stylized graphic showing some alerts being "ignored" while one "critical" (but visually similar) alert also gets ignored.

**NARRATOR:**
Thanks, Erwan. And that experience of "alert fatigue" is incredibly common. When important warnings get lost in the noise, real security risks can easily be overlooked.

**SCENE 3: INTRODUCING AGENTPIMENTBLEU - THE SOLUTION**

**NARRATOR (Transition - tone shifts to hopeful, solution-oriented):**
This is exactly the problem I wanted to tackle with my hackathon project. What if there was a smarter way to analyze these vulnerabilities, one that understands *your* code and tells you what *actually* matters? That's where **AgentPimentBleu** comes in!

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 5: AgentPimentBleu Introduction)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Large, prominent AgentPimentBleu logo (with the üå∂Ô∏è).
    *   Title: "Introducing AgentPimentBleu"
    *   Subtitle: "Smart Security Scanner for Real Impact."
    *   A brief tagline: "Cutting through the noise, focusing on what matters."

**NARRATOR:**
AgentPimentBleu isn't just another CVE lister. It's an AI-powered agent designed to intelligently scan your Git repositories, focusing on the *actual impact* of vulnerabilities within your project's unique context. It helps you filter out the noise and prioritize real risks.

**SCENE 4: DEMO - UI & FEATURES**

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 6: Gradio UI - Input Screen)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "AgentPimentBleu: The Interface"
    *   Text: "Simple input for your Git repository or example projects."
*   **Screenshot:** A full screenshot of the AgentPimentBleu Gradio UI, focusing on the "Scan" tab's input area before any scan is run. Clearly show the "Repository URL or Local Path" input box, the "Example Projects" section, and the "Settings" panel on the left.

**NARRATOR:**
Let's take a quick tour. Here's the Gradio interface. It‚Äôs straightforward: you provide a Git repository URL or select one of the example projects provided.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 7: Gradio UI - Pasting URL & Settings Highlight)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Scanning Your Project"
    *   Text points: "Supports Python & JavaScript" and "Configure LLM & Analysis Parameters".
*   **Screenshot:**
    *   *Main Screenshot:* The Gradio UI with a Git URL pasted into the input box (or an example project selected).
    *   *Inset/Highlight:* Zoom in or use arrows to highlight the "Settings" panel on the left, particularly the API key inputs and the recursion limit slider.

**NARRATOR:**
AgentPimentBleu supports both Python and JavaScript projects. Before we scan, you'll notice some settings on the left. Here, you can override API keys for LLM providers like Gemini or Mistral if you want to use specific models, and also adjust parameters like the analysis graph's recursion limit for more complex projects.

**NARRATOR:**
Once you're ready, you hit 'Scan Repository'.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 8: Scan in Progress & How it Works)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Behind the Scenes: Intelligent Analysis"
    *   Text points:
        *   "Identifies Dependencies & CVEs"
        *   "LLMs Understand CVE Details"
        *   "Retrieval Augmented Generation (LlamaIndex) Scans Your Code for Actual Usage"
*   **Screenshot/Graphic:**
    *   *Top:* Screenshot of the Gradio UI showing the "Status" bar with messages like "Cloning repository...", "Analyzing dependencies...", "LLM analysis in progress...".
    *   *Bottom (or next to text points):* The **Agent Graph image (`dev_context/agent_graph.svg`)**. This is a perfect place to show it!

**NARRATOR:**
Under the hood, AgentPimentBleu gets to work. First, it identifies your project's dependencies and any known CVEs. But then, the AI magic begins! It uses Large Language Models to understand the nitty-gritty of each CVE. Crucially, it also uses a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, using LlamaIndex, to build an index of your actual project code. This allows it to search your codebase for any real usage of the vulnerable components.

**NARRATOR:**
After the analysis, which might take a moment for larger projects or complex vulnerabilities, the results are displayed. You get a clear summary, including a visual chart of vulnerability severity.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 9: Results - Summary & Chart)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Clear & Actionable Results"
    *   Text: "Overall summary and severity distribution."
*   **Screenshot:** Screenshot of the Gradio UI results section, showing:
    *   The "Vulnerability Distribution" pie chart.
    *   The "Summary" tab with the formatted Markdown summary visible.

**NARRATOR:**
The real power comes when you dive into the 'Vulnerability Details' tab. For each identified vulnerability, AgentPimentBleu doesn't just tell you it exists; it provides an AI-generated assessment of its impact *in your project*, evidence from your code if the vulnerable part is used, and a proposed fix.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 10: Results - Vulnerability Details)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Deep Dive: Contextual Impact"
    *   Text: "AI-assessed impact, code evidence, and fix proposals."
*   **Screenshot:** Screenshot of the "Vulnerability Details" tab.
    *   Ensure it shows an expanded vulnerability.
    *   Use arrows or callouts to highlight: "AI Impact Assessment," "Evidence" (especially a code snippet), and "Danger Rating."

**NARRATOR:**
So, instead of just seeing a CVE for 'lodash', you'll see *if and how* your project uses the specific vulnerable lodash function, and what that means for *you*. It even supports `.apbignore` files, similar to `.gitignore`, so you can tell it to skip indexing things like build artifacts, keeping the analysis focused and efficient.

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 11: Focus on Actionable Insights)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "From Noise to Signal"
    *   Text: "Focus on what truly matters with context-aware insights and `.apbignore` support."
*   **Screenshot (Optional):**
    *   A "before" (many generic alerts) and "after" (AgentPimentBleu's prioritized list) comparison (stylized).
    *   Or, a small snippet of an `.apbignore` file.

**SCENE 5: CONCLUSION & PERSONAL TOUCH**

**NARRATOR (Conclusion - tone becomes reflective, then appreciative):**
With AgentPimentBleu, the goal is to transform that overwhelming flood of alerts into a manageable, prioritized list of actionable security insights.

**ERWAN (Voiceover, hopeful):**
"Yeah, something like this would be amazing! If I could quickly see which of those dozens of alerts *actually* needs my attention because it's something I'm using in a risky way? That would save me so much time and stress, and I'd feel much more confident about the security of my projects."

**(VISUAL CUE - SLIDE 12: Erwan's Relief & Project Goal)**
*   **Content:**
    *   Title: "Empowering Developers Like Erwan"
    *   Text (from Erwan's voiceover): "...save so much time and stress... more confident about security."
    *   Erwan's avatar looking relieved or giving a thumbs up.
*   **Screenshot (Optional):** A final, clean shot of AgentPimentBleu's result summary showing "0 Critical, 1 High" or similar, implying focus.
