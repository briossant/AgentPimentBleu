# AgentPimentBleu - Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for AgentPimentBleu, an AI-powered security scanning agent for Git repositories.

## Guiding Principles
*   **Actionable Insights:** Focus on providing security information that developers can act upon, prioritizing impact.
*   **AI-Driven Intelligence:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to go beyond traditional scanning and provide contextual understanding.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilize Gradio to make the tool accessible and easy to use.
*   **Iterative Development:** Start with a core MVP and incrementally add features and improve accuracy.

## Phase 1: Hackathon MVP (June 2 - June 8, 2025) üéØ

**Goal:** Deliver a functional Gradio application showcasing the core concept of AI-driven security analysis with impact assessment for dependencies.

**Key Features & Tasks:**

1.  **Gradio UI - Basics:**
    *   [x] Input field for public Git repository URL.
    *   [x] Button to trigger the scan.
    *   [x] Static area for displaying status messages (e.g., "Cloning...", "Analyzing...").
    *   [x] Output area (e.g., `gr.Markdown`) to display the final report.
2.  **Core Agent Logic - Setup:**
    *   [x] Functionality to clone a public Git repository to a temporary local directory.
    *   [x] Basic error handling for invalid URLs or cloning failures.
3.  **SAST Integration - Initial Pass:**
    *   [x] Integrate JavaScript SAST using ESLint with security plugins.
    *   [x] Integrate Python SAST using Bandit.
    *   [x] Parse basic output from the SAST tools.
    *   [ ] **LLM Enhancement (Proof of Concept):**
        *   Send a few example SAST findings (code snippets) to an LLM.
        *   Prompt LLM for a human-readable explanation of the risk.
4.  **SCA Integration - Initial Pass:**
    *   [x] Integrate JavaScript SCA using npm audit.
    *   [x] Integrate Python SCA using pip-audit.
    *   [x] Parse basic dependency and CVE information.
5.  **‚≠ê AI-Powered Dependency Impact Assessment (Core Feature):**
    *   [ ] For identified vulnerable dependencies:
        *   [ ] Basic code searching mechanism to identify where the dependency is imported/used (e.g., simple string matching for `import library_name`).
        *   [ ] Send CVE information + project usage snippets to an LLM.
        *   [ ] **Prompt LLM to:**
            *   Assess if the described CVE is likely relevant given the project's usage.
            *   Provide a brief explanation of the potential impact *on this project*.
6.  **Report Generation & Display:**
    *   [ ] Structure the output to clearly differentiate:
        *   SAST findings (with any initial LLM comments).
        *   SCA findings, highlighting those with AI-assessed impact.
    *   [ ] Present findings in a readable Markdown format within the Gradio UI.
7.  **Hackathon Submission Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Working Gradio app deployed as a Hugging Face Space.
    *   [ ] `README.md` in the Space with the `agent-demo-track` tag.
    *   [ ] Video overview of the app, its purpose, and a demonstration.

## Phase 2: Post-Hackathon Refinements (Short-Term) üöÄ

**Goal:** Improve the robustness, accuracy, and usability of the MVP. Expand initial capabilities.

*   **Enhanced SAST & SCA: ‚úì**
    *   [x] Implement modular architecture with standardized scanner interfaces
    *   [x] Support for multiple programming languages (JavaScript and Python)
    *   [x] Integrate JavaScript SAST (ESLint with security plugins) and SCA (npm audit)
    *   [x] Integrate Python SAST (Bandit) and SCA (pip-audit)
    *   [ ] Integrate more SAST/SCA tools (e.g., `Semgrep`, `gitleaks`)
    *   [ ] Support for more dependency file formats (e.g., `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `package-lock.json`)
*   **Project Type Detection: ‚úì**
    *   [x] Implement language detection to determine project types
    *   [x] Dynamically select appropriate scanners based on detected languages
*   **Improved LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering:**
    *   [ ] Refine prompts for better accuracy in impact assessment and code analysis
    *   [ ] Develop more sophisticated methods for selecting and sending relevant code context to the LLM
    *   [ ] Explore techniques to reduce LLM hallucination and improve consistency
    *   [ ] Handle LLM API errors gracefully
*   **Advanced Code Usage Analysis (for SCA Impact):**
    *   [ ] Move beyond simple import checking to identify specific function/method calls related to CVEs (might involve Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing or more advanced LLM analysis)
*   **Gradio UI Enhancements:**
    *   [ ] More interactive report display (e.g., collapsible sections, severity filtering, links to CVE details)
    *   [ ] Clearer progress indicators and error messages
    *   [ ] Option to export the report
*   **Configuration Scanning:**
    *   [ ] Specifically target common configuration files (e.g., Dockerfiles, K8s manifests, CI/CD pipeline files, `.env` files) for misconfigurations
*   **Secrets Detection:**
    *   [ ] Integrate a dedicated secrets scanner (e.g., `gitleaks`)
    *   [ ] Use LLM to assess the validity/sensitivity of potential leaked secrets
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Profile and optimize long-running parts of the scan
    *   [ ] Consider asynchronous operations for UI responsiveness

    *   User accounts and team-based reporting.
*   **MCP Server/Tool (Aligning with Hackathon Theme):**
    *   Expose AgentPimentBleu's scanning and assessment capabilities as an MCP tool, allowing other agents or MCP clients to utilize its services.
*   **Community & Open Source Development:**
    *   Foster a community around the project if it gains traction.
